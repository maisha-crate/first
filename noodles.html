    <h1><i>Ingredients needed</i></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Chinese noodles – 1 packet (100 grams)</li>
        <li>Finely chopped garlic -1 1/2 – 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Onion -1</li>
        <li>Cabbage – 1/2 cup thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Carrot – 1 medium size (julienned)</li>
        <li>Capsicum – 1 medium size</li>
        <li>Oil -2 1/2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Soya sauce – 2 tsp</li>
        <li>Chilli sauce – 1/2 tsp or as required</li>
        <li>Pepper powder to taste</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
 
    <h1><em>Preparation</em></h1>
 
 <p>Bring water to boil adding a tsp of oil and 1/2 tsp of salt.<br>
    Then add noodles to the boiling water. <br>
    Stir it now and then to prevent the noodles from sticking together.<br>
    Do not over cook the noodles. <br>
    It should be cooked al dente.<br>Test it by tasting the noodles.<br>
    It should be firm but not hard.<br>
    Drain the noodles in a colander and run cold water over it to prevent it from sticking to each other.<br>
    Cut the vegetables (carrot, onions, cabbage and capsicum) into thin strips as shown below and keep it aside.<br>
    This is a very important step.
    Mixed vegetables for noodles</p>
    <h1><b>Method</b></h1>
 
   <p>Heat oil in a pan, add finely chopped garlic and saute for 2 seconds.<br> Then add onions and saute for a few more seconds on high flame followed by carrot, cabbage and capsicum.<br> Saute the vegetables on high flame.<br>You should not over cook the vegetables ( it should retain the crunchiness).
 
 (I did not add beans.<br> If adding beans,cut it into fine strips diagonally and add it immediately after sauteing onions as beans will take a little longer time to get cooked.<br> After the beans are partially cooked, you can add carrot, cabbage and capsicum)
 Then add soya sauce, chilli sauce and mix well.<br>
 Add the cooked noodles, salt, pepper powder and toss everything together, so that the noodles get coated with the sauces well.<br> Switch off the flame and garnish with spring onion greens.<br>
 
 Serve piping hot with tomato sauce.</p>
